# Welcome to our new blog!

The purpose of this blog is to document the development of PRoot/CARE for posterity.
The goal is to express any concerns or future enhancements in a more informal setting.

Keep in mind, this is in no way a replacement for documentation, which can be found
on the [website](https://proot-me.github.io), and in the [`doc/`](https://github.com/proot-me/proot/tree/master/doc)
directory within the source code for PRoot.

Finally, real-time collaboration happens in the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/proot-me/devs),
and support can also be found on both the [mailing list](mailto:proot_me@googlegroups.com), and the [issue tracker](https://github.com/proot-me/proot/issues).
