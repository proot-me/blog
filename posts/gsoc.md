# Google Summer of Code

Organizations can begin submitting applications for [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] tomorrow, (01/14/2020).
PRoot meets the minimum [requirements][gsoc-terms] for an organization,
however, I am not sure if there are enough active developers.

I spoke with one of the Gentoo developers on Telegram the other day about this, and she told me that
we will probably need at least two active developers in the organization in order to be accepted.
Fortunately, organization administrators can also be mentors on projects, so if I can get one other
developer to help out then we should be set.

[Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach](https://github.com/jopasserat), and [Romain Reuillon](https://github.com/romainreuillon) have agreed
to join me as part of the PRoot GSoC Organization.

Here are some project ideas I had:

- [Implementing libseccomp](https://github.com/proot-me/proot/issues/195)
- [Overhauling the testsuite](https://github.com/proot-me/proot/issues/164)
- [Performance improvements](https://github.com/proot-me/proot/issues/124)

Official project list is here: <https://github.com/proot-me/gsoc>.

If they do not approve PRoot as an organization, then the next idea that I had was to submit
project proposals to other organizations involving PRoot. Specifically, I plan to reach out
to the [Gentoo GSoC Project][gentoo-gsoc] about unprivileged portage running in an [HPC][hpc-wiki] environment.

Finally, I have created a Google account specifically for this program, <lramage.gsoc@gmail.com>.

**UPDATE**

Unfortunately, PRoot was not accepted as an organization this year; but we will try again next year!
