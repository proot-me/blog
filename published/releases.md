# Release Process

The last release [v5.1.0](https://github.com/proot-me/proot/releases/tag/v5.1.0) was from December 15, 2014, (See: [Timeline](timeline.md)).
We need to have more frequent releases for PRoot, so that new features can be tested.

## Next Major Release

Given that this whole [seccomp situation](https://github.com/proot-me/proot/issues/106) is a rather major change, the next version of PRoot will likely be of the `6.x.x` variant. I'll need to look into this a bit further, and check to see if this actually changes the public API.

## Pre-Releases

It would be good to publish pre-releases so that users can test any new features or changes.
